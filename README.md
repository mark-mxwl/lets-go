# Power-Up ðŸ›¸

This simple Bash script speeds up your directory navigation on current projects by eliminating endless/keystrokes/to/the/directory/you/want, as well as the extra command (or click) to open your IDE. Let's save our finger strength for the coding, shall we?

### Getting Started
Place this script inside your home directory--typically `/c/Users/<username>` for Windows and MacOS users--or whichever root directory you've designated for your terminal. Open the script in any text editor and replace the value of `base_path` with your project's parent directory, ie. `~/Documents/Cool_Dude/Dev_Stuff`. You can also replace the `code .` (default for VS Code) command with your IDE of choice.

Once that's sorted, activate your project and IDE via a single, speedy command:

```
$ . lets-go.sh "<project-directory>"
```

If there are other apps you'd like to open alongside your IDE, they can be added to the last line(s) of the `lets_go` function. 

> [!NOTE]
> Make sure you're in your home/root directory before running the script. If you've just opened your terminal, you're all good. If you're not sure where the hell you are, go home: `cd ~`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This script is only compatible with Bash/Zsh shells. If you'd like to use it with PowerShell or Command Prompt, tweak at your own peril.
